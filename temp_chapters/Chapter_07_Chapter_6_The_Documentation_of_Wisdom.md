## Chapter 6: The Documentation of Wisdom

No magical system is complete without proper documentation. We updated our CLAUDE.md file to reflect the new unified approach:

**The Command Hierarchy:**
- **Primary**: The unified `storycode_to_mp3.sh` for complete workflow
- **Legacy**: Individual components marked appropriately for specialized use cases
- **Examples**: Real usage patterns with explanations

**The Integration Guide:**
- Clear explanation of the two-stage architecture
- Metadata standards for consistent output
- Dependency requirements and installation guides
- Troubleshooting information for common issues

**The Migration Path:**
For users familiar with the individual tools, we provided clear guidance on how the new unified system incorporated their functionality while adding intelligence and automation.
