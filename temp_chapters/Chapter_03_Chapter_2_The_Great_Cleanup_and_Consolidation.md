## Chapter 2: The Great Cleanup and Consolidation

Like master architects renovating a castle, we systematically evaluated every tool and artifact:

**The Keepers:**
- voice synthesis gcloud script: Our proven, production-ready voice synthesis tool using the beloved Chirp3-HD-Achernar voice
- Core support files: requirements, setup scripts, demo tools

**The Deprecated:**
- generate storycode audio python script: A complex Python implementation that had served its purpose as a learning tool but was now superseded
- simple TTS demo python script: An incomplete REST API approach that pointed toward solutions but wasn't production-ready
- Debug artifacts: Test files and debugging scripts that had helped us solve problems but now cluttered the path

**The Integration Challenge:**
We needed to merge two distinct systems:
1. **Voice Synthesis**: StoryCode markdown to WAV using gcloud authentication and neural TTS
2. **Audio Enhancement**: WAV to Tagged MP3 using mutagen and pydub

The goal wasn't just to chain these together, but to create an intelligent, unified system that could handle the entire workflow with smart defaults, error handling, and professional output.
