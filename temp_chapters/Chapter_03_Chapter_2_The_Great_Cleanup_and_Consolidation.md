## Chapter 2: The Great Cleanup and Consolidation

Like master architects renovating a castle, we systematically evaluated every tool and artifact:

**The Keepers:**
- `voice_synthesis_gcloud.sh`: Our proven, production-ready voice synthesis tool using the beloved Chirp3-HD-Achernar voice
- Core support files: requirements, setup scripts, demo tools

**The Deprecated:**
- `generate_storycode_audio.py`: A complex Python implementation that had served its purpose as a learning tool but was now superseded
- `simple_tts_demo.py`: An incomplete REST API approach that pointed toward solutions but wasn't production-ready
- Debug artifacts: Test files and debugging scripts that had helped us solve problems but now cluttered the path

**The Integration Challenge:**
We needed to merge two distinct systems:
1. **Voice Synthesis**: StoryCode.md → WAV (using gcloud authentication and neural TTS)
2. **Audio Enhancement**: WAV → Tagged MP3 (using mutagen and pydub)

The goal wasn't just to chain these together, but to create an intelligent, unified system that could handle the entire workflow with smart defaults, error handling, and professional output.
