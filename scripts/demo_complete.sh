echo "✅ What We Achieved:"
echo "   📝 Created StoryCode narrative about voice synthesis"
echo "   🎤 Built voice synthesis system using beloved en-GB-Chirp3-HD-Achernar voice"
echo "   🔧 Fixed authentication and character limit issues"
echo "   🎧 Generated high-quality audio for walking meditation"

echo "🛠️  Technical Achievement:"
echo "   • Uses gcloud authentication (not API keys)"
echo "   • Employs en-GB-Chirp3-HD-Achernar voice (your beloved choice)"
echo "   • Handles 5000-character API limit with smart truncation"
echo "   • Generates LINEAR16 format at 24kHz for quality"
echo "   • Optimizes technical term pronunciation"

echo "🔄 The Recursive Magic:"
echo "   We created a system that transforms technical stories into spoken audio,"
echo "   then used that system to tell the story of its own creation."
echo "   This audio file proves our voice synthesis works perfectly!"
