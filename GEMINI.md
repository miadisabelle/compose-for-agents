# GEMINI.md - Compose for Agents Ecosystem Analysis

This document provides an overview of the various multi-agent systems and applications within the `compose-for-agents` repository. Each project leverages Docker Compose for orchestration and often utilizes the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tool integration and Docker Model Runner for local LLM inference.
