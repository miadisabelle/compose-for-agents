# GEMINI.md - Compose for Agents Ecosystem Analysis

This document provides an overview of the various multi-agent systems and applications within the `compose-for-agents` repository.

## üìù On Writing Effective Commit Messages

As demonstrated by recent interactions, crafting clear, concise, and informative commit messages is crucial for maintaining a healthy and understandable codebase. A good commit message serves as a historical record, explaining *why* a change was made, not just *what* was changed.

**Key Principles for Effective Commit Messages:**

1.  **Subject Line (First Line):**
    *   **Concise:** Keep it under 50-72 characters.
    *   **Imperative Mood:** Use a strong, active verb (e.g., "Fix," "Add," "Refactor," "Update").
    *   **Capitalize First Letter:** Start with a capital letter.
    *   **No Period:** Do not end with a period.
    *   **Prefix (Optional but Recommended):** Use a prefix to categorize the change (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`).

2.  **Body (After a Blank Line):**
    *   **Explain the "Why":** Detail the motivation for the change, the problem it solves, and any context that might be helpful for future readers.
    *   **Elaborate on "What":** Provide more technical details about the implementation if necessary, but avoid simply repeating the code.
    *   **Use Bullet Points or Paragraphs:** Structure the information for readability.
    *   **Wrap Lines:** Keep lines around 72 characters for better readability in various git tools.

**Example of a Good Commit Message:**

```
