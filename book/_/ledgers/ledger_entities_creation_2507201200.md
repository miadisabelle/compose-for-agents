# Ledger: Entity Graph Construction

**Timestamp:** 2025-07-20 12:00

## Objective
Populate the `storiesSoftware3_0_memory` knowledge graph with a comprehensive set of entities and hierarchical relations extracted from the Software 3.0 research materials and attached mind-map images.

## Actions Performed
1. Created 48 new entities covering six major thematic clusters:
   - Evolution of Software in AI Era (root)
   - Software Paradigms (1.0, 2.0, 3.0)
   - LLMs: Analogies and Properties (utility, fab, OS, diffusion flip, psychology)
   - Opportunities: Programming LLMs (partial autonomy, cooperation loop, NL interface, agent infrastructure, Iron Man analogy)
   - Perplexity product focus (8 sub-topics)
   - Elon Musk perspectives (8 sub-topics)
   - Sam Altman perspectives (12 sub-topics)
2. Added 47 `subtopic_of` relations to encode the hierarchy from root → category → sub-item.
3. Stored all data in MCP memory `storiesSoftware3_0_memory` via create_entities and create_relations calls.

## Outcome
The graph now contains rich, navigable structure (>30 entities) ready for downstream StoryCode generation or further enrichment.
