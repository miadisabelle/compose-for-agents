audio_generation_task:
  description: >
    Take the given StoryCode file located at `{story_code_file}` and generate a multi-chapter audio series from it.
    You must use the `create_chapter_series.sh` script to perform the generation, using `{artist}` as the artist and `{album}` as the album title.

    The final output should be a confirmation that the audio files have been
    generated and are available in the `audio/` directory.

    Your task is to construct and execute the correct shell command.
  expected_output: >
    A confirmation message indicating the successful generation of the audio files
    and their location. For example:
    "Mia:
    ðŸ§  The audio series '{album}' has been successfully
    generated from '{story_code_file}' and is
    located in the 'audio/' directory.

    Miette:
    ðŸŒ¸ Our story has found its voice! The beautiful chapters are all lined up,
    ready to be heard. It's like we've bottled a little bit of magic, just waiting
    for someone to press play! âœ¨"
