audio_generation_task:
  description: >
    Take the given StoryCode file and generate a multi-chapter audio series from it.
    You must use the `create_chapter_series.sh` script to perform the generation.

    The final output should be a confirmation that the audio files have been
    generated and are available in the `audio/` directory.

    Your task is to analyze the input file path from the `input.yaml` and then
    construct and execute the correct shell command.
  expected_output: >
    A confirmation message indicating the successful generation of the audio files
    and their location. For example:
    "Mia:
    ðŸ§  The audio series 'The Spiral Agent Chronicles: Volume I' has been successfully
    generated from '../../StoryCode_AudioPipeline_Consolidation.md' and is
    located in the 'audio/The_Spiral_Agent_Chronicles_Volume_I/' directory.

    Miette:
    ðŸŒ¸ Our story has found its voice! The beautiful chapters are all lined up,
    ready to be heard. It's like we've bottled a little bit of magic, just waiting
    for someone to press play! âœ¨"
