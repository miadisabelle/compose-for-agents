# 🧠 CrewAI Marketing Team Demo

This project showcases an autonomous, multi-agent **virtual marketing team** built with
[CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI). It automates the creation of a high-quality, end-to-end
marketing strategy — from research to copywriting — using task delegation, web search, and creative
synthesis.

> [!Tip]
> ✨ No configuration needed — run it with a single command.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

+ **[Docker Desktop] 4.43.0+ or [Docker Engine]** installed.
+ **A laptop or workstation with a GPU** (e.g., a MacBook) for running open models locally. If you
  don't have a GPU, you can alternatively use **[Docker Offload]**.
+ If you're using [Docker Engine] on Linux or [Docker Desktop] on Windows, ensure that the
  [Docker Model Runner requirements] are met (specifically that GPU
  support is enabled) and the necessary drivers are installed.
+ If you're using Docker Engine on Linux, ensure you have [Docker Compose] 2.38.1 or later installed.

### Run the Project

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

That’s all. The agents will spin up and collaborate through a series of predefined roles and tasks to
deliver a complete marketing strategy for the input project.

# 🧠 Inference Options

By default, this project uses [Docker Model Runner] to handle LLM inference locally — no internet
connection or external API key is required.

If you’d prefer to use OpenAI instead:

1. Create a `secret.openai-api-key` file with your OpenAI API key:

    ```plaintext
    sk-...
    ```

2. Restart the project with the OpenAI configuration:

    ```sh
    docker compose down -v
    docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.openai.yaml up
    ```

## ❓ What Can It Do?

Give it a company and a project description — the agents will collaborate to produce a full marketing strategy:

+ “Research the market landscape around CrewAI’s automation tools.”
+ “Understand the target audience for enterprise AI integrations.”
+ “Formulate a high-impact marketing strategy with KPIs and channels.”
+ “Propose 5 creative campaigns tailored to tech decision-makers.”
+ “Write compelling ad copy for each campaign idea.”

From strategy to storytelling, the team handles it all — autonomously.

You can **customize the tasks** to use your own domain and project description — just edit the inputs in `src/marketing_posts/config/inputs.yaml`.

+ PostgreSQL is populated from a SQLite dump at runtime.
+ All components are fully containerized for plug-and-play usage.

# 🧹 Cleanup

To stop and remove containers and volumes:

```sh
docker compose down -v
```
