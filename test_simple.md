## Chapter 2: The Great Cleanup and Consolidation

Like master architects renovating a castle, we systematically evaluated every tool and artifact.

The keepers: voice synthesis gcloud script, our proven production-ready voice synthesis tool using the beloved Chirp3 HD Achernar voice, and core support files including requirements, setup scripts, and demo tools.

The deprecated: generate storycode audio python script, a complex Python implementation that had served its purpose as a learning tool but was now superseded.

The integration challenge: We needed to merge two distinct systems. Voice synthesis from StoryCode markdown to WAV using gcloud authentication and neural TTS. Audio enhancement from WAV to tagged MP3 using mutagen and pydub.

The goal was not just to chain these together, but to create an intelligent, unified system that could handle the entire workflow with smart defaults, error handling, and professional output.
